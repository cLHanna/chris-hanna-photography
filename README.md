This is a two fold website that I will be working on alongside my IT
schooling. The first fold is the experimentation of what I've learned in IT so far, and 
the second fold is building a website to showcase and build my passion for photography. I 
hope to make a seemingly basic portfolio website a fun place on the front and back-end to 
grow as a IT professional.
